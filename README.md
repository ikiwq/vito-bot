VitoBot is a Discord bot designed to provide utilities for self-hosted Minecraft servers. It is a _self-hosted_ bot and is preferably (though not necessarily) hosted on the same machine as your Minecraft servers.

The default modules currently available include:
- Tracking the hosting server's IP
- Tracking a list of Minecraft servers, as selected by the admin

# Future plans and To-Do List

Since VitoBot is a new project, its modules and features are currently limited. We're actively working to expand its capabilities. Planned features include:
- A wiki page to help less experience users and developers to configure or extends the bot functionalities
- A custom-built integration with Minecraft chat
- A role-based moderation system for Minecraft servers, managed through Discord
- Audio and music command support, with integration for Spotify and other platforms
